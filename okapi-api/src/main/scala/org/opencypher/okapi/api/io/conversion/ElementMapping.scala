/**
  * Represents a mapping from a source with key-based access of element components (e.g. a table definition) to a Pattern.
  * The purpose of this class is to define a mapping from an external data source to a property graph.
  *
  * The [[pattern]] describes the shape of the pattern that is described by this mapping
  *
  * The [[idKeys]] describe the mappings for each pattern element, which map the element identifiers
  * to columns within the source data.
  *
  * The [[properties]] represent mappings for every pattern element from property keys to keys in the source data.
  * The retrieved value from the source is expected to be convertible to a valid [[org.opencypher.okapi.api.value.CypherValue]].
  *
  * @param pattern    the pattern described by this mapping
  * @param properties mapping from property key to source property key
  * @param idKeys     mapping for the key to access the element identifier in the source data
